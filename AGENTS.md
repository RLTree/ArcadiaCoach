# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `backend/`: FastAPI entrypoint (`app/`), agent tooling, curriculum sequencer, and upload/grading services. Treat this as the source of truth for agent orchestration, REST APIs, and persistence helpers.
- `mcp_server/`: FastMCP-compatible widget service that streams lesson/quiz/milestone/focus sprint envelopes to the agent. Run this locally when developing widget payloads.
- `Resources/`, `Views/`, `ViewModels/`, `Services/`, `Models/`, `Tests/`: macOS SwiftUI client. Widgets live under `Resources/Widgets/`, shared assets stay in `Resources/`, and unit tests belong in `Tests/`.
- `docs/`: Phase snapshots, runbooks, and troubleshooting guides (kept in lockstep with the roadmap).
- `openai-agents-python/`, `openai-chatkit-advanced-samples/`: upstream SDK examples referenced during prototyping—do not modify unless syncing from upstream.
- Root-level config (`prompts-agents-maintenance.md`, `render.yaml`, `Package.swift`, etc.) describes deployment, prompt hygiene, and Swift package settings.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Backend: `cd backend && uv sync && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`.
- MCP widgets: `cd mcp_server && uv sync && uv run python server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001`.
- Backend lint/tests: `cd backend && uv run ruff check && uv run pytest`.
- macOS client: `open ArcadiaCoach.xcodeproj` → build/run the **ArcadiaCoach** scheme (Debug for development, Release for distribution).
- Swift unit tests: run `swift test` from the repository root so model + view-model coverage executes.
- Always open `ArcadiaCoach.xcodeproj` and build the **ArcadiaCoach** scheme before shipping changes; `swift test` can pass while an actual Xcode build fails due to UI or integration issues, so treat the full app build as part of the standard test matrix.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Python: Black/PEP 8, 4-space indents, snake_case. Keep docstrings concise and run `uv run ruff check` plus `uv run pytest` before pushing.
- Swift: 4-space indents, UpperCamelCase types, lowerCamelCase members. Widget JSON assets stay in PascalCase (e.g., `ArcadiaChatbot.widget`).
- TypeScript/JS (sample integrations): Prettier defaults with camelCase functions/variables and PascalCase components. Treat `openai-*` sample folders as read-only unless explicitly prototyping.

## Testing Guidelines
- Backend: add pytest coverage under `backend/tests/` (use `test_<feature>.py` naming). Every new service (e.g., curriculum sequencer, assessment storage) needs happy path + failure mode tests.
- Swift: group tests by feature (`Tests/<FeatureName>Tests.swift`) and cover onboarding, assessment delivery, dashboard history, and chat continuity.
- Aim for ≥80 % coverage on new modules; document any gaps in PR descriptions and open follow-up tasks when deferring tests.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages follow `<scope>: <imperative summary>` (e.g., `backend: add curriculum sequencer`). Keep commits focused; include migration or data backfill notes in the body when relevant.
- Pull Requests require a concise summary, explicit testing checklist (`uv run …`, `swift test`, screenshots for UI), and links to roadmap phases or issues. Request reviews from backend and client owners when touching both stacks.

| Default Model | `gpt-5` (`ARCADIA_AGENT_MODEL`) |
| Reasoning Effort | `medium` (`ARCADIA_AGENT_REASONING`; prompt overlay upgrades per turn) |
| Web Search | Off by default (`ARCADIA_AGENT_ENABLE_WEB=false`); toggled per chat turn in the macOS client |

## Tools

The agent is configured with:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|

Hosted MCP calls are proxied through the backend (see `backend/app/arcadia_agent.py` and `backend/app/tools.py`).

MCP endpoint: `https://mcp.arcadiacoach.com/mcp` (Render service). It exposes:

- `lesson_catalog`
- `quiz_results`
- `milestone_update`
- `focus_sprint`

## Environment Variables

| `ARCADIA_MCP_REQUIRE_APPROVAL` | MCP approval strategy (default `never`) |
| `ARCADIA_DEBUG_ENDPOINTS` | `true` to expose debugging routes in non-production builds |

## Local Debugging Checklist

1. Export env vars (or create `backend/.env`):
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   export ARCADIA_MCP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp   # if running MCP locally
   export ARCADIA_AGENT_MODEL=gpt-5
   ```
2. Start the MCP server:
   ```bash
   cd mcp_server
   uv run python server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001
   ```
3. Apply database migrations (first run and whenever schema changes land):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m scripts.run_migrations
   ```
   _Need a specific revision?_ Use `uv run alembic upgrade <revision>` instead. Backfill legacy data with `uv run python -m scripts.backfill_json_stores` if needed.
4. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
5. Test the agent directly:
   ```python
   from agents import Runner, RunConfig, ModelSettings
   from backend.app.arcadia_agent import ArcadiaAgentContext, get_arcadia_agent

   agent = get_arcadia_agent("gpt-5", False)
   context = ArcadiaAgentContext.model_construct(thread=..., store=..., request_context={})
   Runner.run_sync(agent, "learn transformers", context=context,
                   run_config=RunConfig(model_settings=ModelSettings()))
   ```
6. On the macOS Dashboard, use the **Upcoming Schedule** refresh button to hit `GET /api/profile/<username>/schedule?refresh=true` and confirm cadence notes/day offsets match the backend response.
7. (Optional) Snapshot pool health for on-call handoffs:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m scripts.db_metrics
   ```

**Hosted-only limitation:** The production backend runs at `https://chat.arcadiacoach.com`, and the MCP server lives at `https://mcp.arcadiacoach.com` (tool base URL `https://mcp.arcadiacoach.com/mcp`). Because OpenAI requires the domain to be pre-approved, we cannot exercise the full stack against localhost; all integration tests must target the hosted endpoints.

## Widgets

- `Resources/Widgets/ArcadiaChatbot.widget` powers the ChatKit embed (served via `ChatPanel`).
- MCP widgets return `Card`, `List`, `StatRow`, and other envelope types. The backend normalises props before returning to Swift to keep widget schemas stable across releases.

Keep this section up to date as agent configuration changes (new tools, model upgrades, etc.).

# Arcadia Coach Vision & Goals

Arcadia Coach is being upgraded into an adaptive, goal-driven coding mentor for AuDHD learners. The app must:

- Onboard each learner with a username + OpenAI key, then capture their long-term coding goals, intended use-cases, current strengths, and accessibility needs via an agent-led conversation.
- Let the agent decide when it needs more context before designing a long-term curriculum, and generate lessons, assignments, quizzes, and milestone projects that stay aligned with those goals.
- Maintain persistent memory of goals, knowledge state, completed work, and next steps; agents default to web-enabled GPT‑5 / GPT‑5‑codex with high reasoning for content creation, grading, and support.
- Deliver thorough, presentation-style, AuDHD-friendly lessons and interactive assessments entirely inside the app; quizzes and assignments are graded in-app and feed the player’s ELO ratings.
- Run daily science-backed refreshers and mini comprehension checks before new material.
- Keep the milestone system gated by ELO thresholds: milestones unlock once users demonstrate proficiency, contribute to—but do not solely drive—ELO progression, and provide clear success criteria while being executed outside the app (with in-app coaching).
- Present a sleek macOS UI with sidebar navigation (ELO dashboard by category, chatbot, settings, help) and support milestone/project tracking.

All upgrades must preserve these goals while improving agent orchestration, memory, and experience cohesion.

# Implementation Roadmap

Use the roadmap below to scope future tasks. When a phase is “completed”, new threads should snapshot the resulting state before moving on.

1. **Phase 0 – Discovery Refresh** ✅ *(completed October 12, 2025; see `docs/phase-0-discovery.md`)*
   - Map current onboarding data flow.
   - Catalogue existing lesson/quiz widgets.
   - Document present ELO categories.
   - Confirm backend ↔ Swift messaging gaps for profile + session metadata.
2. **Phase 1 – Goal Intake & Profile Memory** ✅ *(completed October 12, 2025; see `docs/phase-1-goal-intake.md`)*
   - Harden the new profile capture.
   - Persist learner goals/use-case/strengths.
   - Expose profile/memory agent tools seeded with vector store `vs_68e81d741f388191acdaabce2f92b7d5`.
3. **Phase 2 – ELO Category Planning** ✅ *(completed October 12, 2025; see `docs/phase-2-elo-category-planning.md`)*
   - Enable the agent to call `learner_elo_category_plan_set` and persist goal-aligned skill categories with weights + rubrics.
   - Sync category plans into learner profiles and expose `/api/profile/{username}` + `/api/profile/{username}/elo-plan` for the client.
   - Update the macOS app to fetch and display the stored plan (Home dashboard + quiz summaries) before assessments begin.
4. **Phase 3 – Onboarding Assessment Engine** ✅ *(completed October 12, 2025; see `docs/phase-3-onboarding-assessment.md`)*
   - Trigger automatic curriculum planning immediately after onboarding completes, without requiring a manual chat turn.
   - Derive the learner’s ELO category plan directly from the generated curriculum and persist it for client use.
   - Generate and cache a personalised assessment (conceptual + coding tasks per category) once the plan exists.
   - Build MCP widgets + SwiftUI flows for multi-question delivery with embedded code editor.
   - Capture user responses locally and block assessment launch until curriculum + categories are ready.
   - Resize the macOS assessment overlay to fit smaller viewports and only count coding prompts as answered after edits beyond starter code.
5. **Phase 4 – Submission Loop & Developer Reset** ✅ *(completed October 12, 2025; see `docs/phase-4-submission-loop.md`)*
   - Add the developer-facing reset control that clears learner profile + local assessment state (preserves stored OpenAI key and backend settings).
   - Expose a manual submission endpoint + storage path for completed assessment responses.
   - Provide a lightweight dashboard view to inspect stored submissions for debugging.
6. **Phase 5 – Automated Grading & Initial Ratings** ✅ *(completed October 12, 2025; see `docs/phase-5-automated-grading.md`)*
   - Wire automated grading into the onboarding submission loop, persist rubric-aligned feedback, and seed initial ELO ratings from the resulting scores.
   - Surface grading summaries to the macOS dashboard (with a loading gate while grading runs) and mirror the data in developer tooling for inspection.
   - Follow-ups: tune the grading prompt after analysing real submissions, add integration tests that cover the fallback path and rating interpolation, and document the grading schema for future prompt work.
7. **Phase 6 – Frontend Chat & Accessibility Enhancements** ✅ *(completed October 13, 2025; see `docs/phase-6-frontend-chat-accessibility.md`)*
   - Deliver the upgraded Agent Chat panel with per-model capability picker, reasoning effort controls, attachment rendering, and a persisted transcript sidebar.
   - Harden attachment policies (full files for GPT-5/Mini, images-only for GPT-5 Codex) while keeping web search available per model selection.
   - Follow-up: move the “read attachments before responding” guidance into the chat prompt so `file_search` is always invoked when files are present (tracked under Phase 30).
8. **Phase 7 – Chat Continuity & Prompt Hardening** ✅ *(completed October 13, 2025; see `docs/phase-7-chat-continuity.md`)*
   - Centralise prompt overlays so GPT-5/Mini always run `file_search` on attachments, GPT-5 Codex leans on inline previews, and web-enabled turns call `web_search` with Markdown hyperlink citations.
   - Add session resume support in the macOS client (active transcript tracking, sidebar ordering, resume button) without resetting backend threads.
   - Render chat bubbles with Markdown-aware text so citations and links are clickable inside the app.
   - Follow-ups: add automated tests to confirm `file_search`/`web_search` tool invocation sequences, track hyperlink rendering inside MCP widgets, capture telemetry on tool success rates (see Phases 24 & 27), and decouple reasoning effort selection from model selection so users can mix any reasoning tier with any supported model.
9. **Phase 8 – Dashboard Assessment History** ✅ *(completed October 13, 2025; see `docs/phase-8-dashboard-assessment-history.md`)*
   - Add dashboard readiness summary, submission history list, and calibrated ELO callouts, mirrored in the chat sidebar for continuity.
   - Extend backend profile payloads and Swift models with assessment submission history plus legacy-safe decoding to avoid regressions during rollout.
   - Follow-ups: add UI regression tests for readiness states, instrument telemetry on history/grade status transitions, monitor payload growth (introduce pagination if needed), and remove the legacy decode shim once the persistence migration standardises the schema (Phases 24–25).
10. **Phase 9 – Feedback Drilldowns & Learner Insights** ✅ *(completed October 13, 2025; see `docs/phase-9-feedback-drilldowns.md`)*
    - Delivered detailed submission drilldowns with rubric notes, attachment manifests, and category ELO deltas in both dashboard and chat surfaces.
    - Normalised assessment submissions to include parsed attachments and explicit rating deltas across backend APIs and client models.
    - Captured the latest lesson/quiz/milestone envelopes so learners can revisit content immediately after agent actions.
   - Follow-ups: add UI coverage for the new detail view (Phase 37) and expand curriculum tie-ins alongside the milestone roadmap (Phase 22).
   
11. **Phase 10 – Assessment Attachment UX & Agent Ingestion** ✅ *(completed October 13, 2025; see `docs/phase-10-assessment-attachment-ux-agent-ingestion.md`)*
    - Replaced the metadata workaround with a structured `attachments` array on submissions, populated from the new attachment store (legacy metadata remains a fallback parser).
    - Shipped the full upload pipeline: REST endpoints, on-disk persistence, developer reset purge, and a macOS attachment manager (file picker + link entry) that auto-populates submissions.
    - Surfaced structured attachments across profile/developer APIs and piped attachment descriptors into grading payloads so the agent can ingest learner-provided context.
    - Extended regression coverage for upload/link/delete flows, download endpoints, and submission payloads to guard the new storage/ingestion path.
    - Follow-ups: add inline previews for common attachment types, capture ingestion telemetry, harden storage encryption ahead of the persistence migration, and resolve Swift 6 concurrency warnings raised by shared formatters (see follow-up assignments under Phases 18–21, 25, 26, and the new Known Corrections entry).
12. **Phase 11 – Curriculum Sequencer Foundations** ✅ *(completed October 13, 2025; see `docs/phase-11-curriculum-sequencer-foundations.md`)*
    - Delivered a deterministic sequencing service that prioritises lessons, quizzes, and a milestone using learner goals, ELO snapshots, curriculum modules, and assessment deltas.
    - Persisted schedules on learner profiles, surfaced them via `GET /api/profile/{username}/schedule`, and added a dashboard refresh control backed by the new endpoint.
    - Normalised shared schedule models/tests so both backend and macOS client decode the same schema; follow up with telemetry and chat consumption work during Phase 12.
    - Follow-ups: instrument schedule generation telemetry, add failure fallbacks, and pipe schedule summaries into the chat overlay (tracked in Phase 12 and Phase 13).
13. **Phase 12 – Sequencer Telemetry & Reliability Hardening** ✅ *(completed October 14, 2025; see `docs/phase-12-sequencer-telemetry.md`)*
    - Instrumented schedule generation and refresh paths with structured telemetry (duration, item count, horizon, status) and a reusable logger/listener helper.
    - Added resilient fallbacks: failed refreshes now reuse the previous schedule, mark it `is_stale`, and surface warning metadata to both API and SwiftUI.
    - Triggered automatic schedule regeneration immediately after onboarding grading and updated the agent prompt so Chat answers reference `curriculum_schedule` data.
    - Expanded regression coverage for telemetry fan-out, fallback warnings, and post-grading schedule creation.
    - **Follow-ups:** Stream telemetry into production observability once the persistence migration lands and finish the richer citation UX (tracked under Phase 32).
14. **Phase 13 – Adaptive Curriculum MVP** ✅ *(completed October 14, 2025; see `docs/phase-13-adaptive-curriculum-mvp.md`)*
    - Regenerated curriculum schedules immediately after onboarding so every learner leaves planning with a populated 2–3 week roadmap.
    - Persisted learner `schedule_adjustments`, surfaced `user_adjusted` flags in schedule payloads, and taught the sequencer to honour deferrals on refresh.
    - Added the `/api/profile/{username}/schedule/adjust` endpoint, dashboard reschedule controls, and telemetry covering adjustment requests and applied deltas.
    - Hardened schedule refresh performance by short-circuiting identical regenerations so the backend skips redundant writes.
    - **Follow-ups:** Localise schedule output to the learner’s timezone (Phase 14), monitor `schedule_generation` telemetry for unexpected spikes, and extend UI affordances for pulling work forward.
15. **Phase 14 – Schedule Localization & Time Semantics** ✅ *(completed October 14, 2025; see `docs/phase-14-schedule-localization.md`)*
    - Persisted learner timezone context end-to-end (onboarding, client metadata, backend profiles) so scheduling logic always knows the correct locale.
    - Localised curriculum schedules across APIs, chat prompts, and SwiftUI with DST-aware dates and timezone abbreviations.
    - Added the `current_time` agent tool and prompt guidance so Arcadia Coach can report precise, localised timestamps without asking the learner.
    - Refreshed dashboard schedule views to show per-item local timestamps that mirror the agent’s schedule summaries.
    - **Follow-ups:** Instrument `current_time` usage and localisation telemetry, expose a user-facing timezone override, and extend localisation to exported artefacts (milestone briefs, summaries).
16. **Phase 16 – Adaptive Foundations & Assessment Overhaul** ✅ *(completed October 14, 2025; see `docs/phase-16-adaptive-foundations.md`)*
    - Stand up a dedicated *Goal Parser Agent* that ingests the learner’s long-term goals, strengths, and context, then infers the complete stack of prerequisite languages, frameworks, libraries, and tooling (e.g., Python, SQL, Pandas, CUDA, SwiftUI) needed to achieve that vision.
    - Maintain a living curriculum module library (templates are modular building blocks, not rigid scripts) so the agent can assemble, adapt, or synthesize beginner-to-expert progressions for each inferred technology—duplicating, remixing, or authoring new modules whenever the library lacks coverage.
    - Redesign the onboarding assessment into a longer, multi-section evaluation (conceptual, coding, data manipulation, architecture, tooling) so the agent has broad coverage to baseline current knowledge and confidence.
    - Generate dynamic ELO category plans that grow beyond five categories, with the agent weighting new foundational categories whenever the learner indicates gaps (“I don’t know”) or the assessment scores reveal missing fundamentals.
    - Update schedule and module sequencing logic to deliver multi-month roadmaps that revisit foundations until mastery thresholds are hit, with reinforcement lessons tied directly to the agent’s goal-to-foundation mapping.
    - **Follow-ups:** instrument telemetry that shows which goal-parser inferences and foundation tracks are activated per learner, add low-friction tooling to author new module templates, and explore adaptive assessment shortening once mid-course mastery is demonstrated.
17. **Phase 17 – Foundational Validation & Horizon Expansion** ✅ *(completed October 14, 2025; see `docs/phase-17-foundational-validation.md`)*
    - Clamped goal-parser outputs so every track and recommended module emits a strictly positive `suggested_weeks`, with validation mirrored in Swift decoding.
    - Guaranteed onboarding assessment coverage for every stored ELO category (concept + code + scenario), adding regression tests and lightweight defaults for template gaps.
    - Extended the curriculum sequencer to plan multi-month horizons and emit additional pacing metadata (sessions/week, projected weekly minutes, long-range counts) consumed by the macOS client.
    - Logged horizon telemetry (duration, category allocations, refresh cadence) to observe load and deferral pressure across the extended roadmap.
    - **Follow-ups:** surface extended-horizon summaries inside chat and dashboard once telemetry confirms the cadence is stable, and stream the new telemetry into production observability (coordinate with the updated Phases 20 & 22).
18. **Phase 18 – Sequencer Long-Range Balancing** ✅ *(completed October 15, 2025; see `docs/phase-18-sequencer-long-range-balancing.md`)*  
    - Reordered module chunk sequencing with guardrails that cap consecutive streaks and ensure the opening 6–8 weeks represent at least three categories.  
    - Enforced dependency-aware curriculum ordering so prerequisite modules always precede dependent work before applying priority-based mixing.  
    - Split oversized lessons/quizzes/milestones into ≤120-minute parts so long-form content stretches over additional sessions instead of being trimmed.  
    - Reworked `_inject_long_range_refreshers` into a round-robin cycle so long-range lessons and quizzes rotate across priority categories while respecting prerequisite ordering.  
    - Added `_summarize_distribution` telemetry and emit `long_range_distribution` with per-category counts, longest runs, first-week appearances, and near-term coverage.  
    - Backfilled regression coverage for near-term mixing, long-range streak caps, and telemetry payloads, then refreshed roadmap/doc snapshots to highlight the balancing instrumentation.  
    - **Follow-ups:** Monitor the new telemetry in staging, adjust streak caps if imbalance resurfaces, and feed milestone unlock signals into the distribution summary during Phase 20.

19. **Phase 19 – Persistence Migration – Data Layer** ✅ *(completed October 15, 2025; see `docs/phase-19-persistence-migration.md`)*  
    - Replaced the JSON-backed stores with SQLAlchemy repositories and Alembic migrations so learner profiles, submissions, schedules, and attachments now live in PostgreSQL.  
    - Added connection management helpers, pooling defaults, and a `backfill_json_stores.py` utility to migrate historical data safely.  
    - Documented new database env vars, developer workflow updates, and Render rollout steps so teammates can apply migrations consistently.  
    - **Follow-ups:** automate Alembic migrations within the deployment pipeline, add database health/telemetry dashboards, and harden rollback tooling (tracked under Phases 45–47).

20. **Phase 20 – Persistence Migration – Client Integration** ✅ *(completed October 15, 2025; see `docs/phase-20-persistence-migration-client.md`)*  
    - Added persistence-mode switching (`database` / `legacy` / `hybrid`) so phased rollouts can fail over safely.  
    - Delivered schedule pagination + caching for backend APIs, the macOS client, and agent tooling to reduce payload size.  
    - Updated Swift models and telemetry to handle slice-aware refresh flows with offline caches.  
    - **Follow-ups:** extend slice support to MCP widgets (Phase 27).

21. **Phase 21 – Persistence Migration – Automation & Observability** ✅ *(completed October 15, 2025; see `docs/phase-21-persistence-automation.md`)*  
    - Wrapped backend boot in `start.sh` so `python -m scripts.run_migrations` blocks deployments on schema drift before Uvicorn starts.  
    - Added `/healthz/database`, pool instrumentation, and the `scripts.db_metrics` probe so ops can monitor connection health in staging/production.  
    - Authored the database recovery runbook covering backup validation, failover rotation, and rollback paths.  
    - **Follow-ups:** wire `db_pool_status` telemetry into Render alerts, add migration-duration metrics, and stage automated rollback drills (Phases 45–47).
22. **Phase 22 – ELO Integrity & Responsiveness** ✅ *(completed October 15, 2025; see `docs/phase-22-elo-integrity.md`)*
    - Deduplicated overlapping ELO categories (label-first canonical keys) and foundation tracks, emitting `elo_category_collision` telemetry when merges occur.
    - Adopted schedule slicing across backend tools, agent prompts, and the macOS client, adding the `schedule_slice` telemetry event for latency monitoring.
    - Upgraded client caching with per-slice persistence, "Load more" UX, debounce guards, and UI-side dedupe so the dashboard never shows duplicate tiles.
    - Added automatic hybrid resync so legacy fallbacks replay into Postgres once database connectivity returns.
    - **Follow-ups:** Extend dedupe heuristics for near-matching labels and add automated UI tests that assert one tile per category/track.
23. **Phase 23 – Dashboard Navigation & Tabbed Layout** ✅ *(completed October 15, 2025; see `docs/phase-23-dashboard-navigation.md`)*
    - Introduced segmented dashboard tabs (ELO, Schedule, Assessments, Resources) with persisted selection backed by `AppSettings`.
    - Extracted dashboard subviews into `Views/Dashboard/` components and moved session controls/content into the Resources tab with onboarding/assessment gating intact.
    - Wired new telemetry (`dashboard_tab_selected`, `session_action_triggered`) and refreshed the Xcode project to include the dashboard sources.
    - **Follow-ups:** add learner-level tab engagement analytics and ship a post-grading prompt that nudges learners toward the Assessments tab when results land.
24. **Phase 24 – Assessment Surface Lifecycle** ✅ *(completed October 15, 2025; see `docs/phase-24-assessment-surface-lifecycle.md`)*
    - Hid the Assessment tab once calibration completes while keeping developer resets and in-progress bundles responsive through `AppViewModel.requiresAssessment`.
    - Added a dashboard nudge and summary highlighting fresh grading, backed by the new `AssessmentResultTracker` so unseen results persist across launches and resets.
    - Instrumented unseen-result telemetry and persisted the last reviewed submission ID to support future analytics and automation.
    - **Follow-ups:** stream unseen-result telemetry into the observability dashboards (Phase 45) and explore auto-expanding the latest graded submission when the nudge clears (Phase 37).
25. **Phase 25 – Clipboard & Selection Support** ✅ *(completed October 15, 2025; see `docs/phase-25-clipboard-selection.md`)*
    - Delivered a shared `AppClipboardManager` and reusable `selectableContent` modifier so chat, lessons, assessments, widgets, and dashboard panels all support Command+C plus context-menu copying.
    - Hardened accessibility by auditing VoiceOver/keyboard flows, pruning recursive selection states that triggered the AttributeGraph loop, and adding schedule/assessment copy affordances.
    - Added `ClipboardSupportTests` and refreshed the Xcode target so future Swift-only additions stay registered for both SwiftPM and the macOS build.
    - **Follow-ups:** Extend copy telemetry to observe high-friction surfaces and add localized copy hints once the schedule-driven launch work lands (Phase 26).
26. **Phase 26 – Schedule-Driven Session Launch** ✅ *(completed October 15, 2025; see `docs/phase-26-schedule-driven-session-launch.md`)*
    - Added launch metadata to curriculum schedules plus Alembic migrations so in-progress work persists across refreshes.
    - Shipped new `/api/session/schedule/launch` + `/complete` endpoints, milestone lock handling, and telemetry updates (`schedule_launch_initiated`/`schedule_launch_completed`).
    - Revamped the macOS schedule UI with status pills, start/resume/complete controls, milestone confirmation dialogs, and removed the legacy session buttons in the Resources tab.
    - Updated Swift services/view models to consume launch responses, record latest content, sync ELO changes, and surface progress in dashboard resources.
    - **Follow-ups:** Add backend launch/complete API tests, extend Swift UI coverage for locked milestone flows, add regression coverage to ensure schedule slices persist after launches, and stream launch/completion telemetry into production dashboards.
27. **Phase 27 – Milestone Brief Foundations**
    - Generate detailed milestone briefs (objectives, deliverables, success parameters) that live entirely in-app.
    - Clarify which work must happen outside the app while capturing progress notes and artefacts back into Arcadia.
    - Ensure briefs surface prerequisite lessons/quizzes and ELO dependencies before milestones unlock.
28. **Phase 28 – Milestone Progress Integration**

    - Display milestone status and outstanding deliverables across dashboard, chat, and MCP widgets using the new slice endpoints.
    - Extend paginated schedule delivery to MCP widgets and chat overlays to keep milestone context lightweight.
29. **Phase 29 – Lesson Deck Foundations**
    - Render lessons as presentation-style decks with narrative slides, inline code/examples, and citations to supporting papers/docs.
    - Establish shared deck components and export formats so both chat and dashboard views reuse the same content.
    - Ensure lessons remain self-contained so learners can progress without leaving the app while still offering optional deep-dive links.
30. **Phase 30 – Lesson Comprehension & Knowledge Checks**
    - Bundle comprehension checks at the end of each lesson and sync outcomes into the sequencer and ELO model.
    - Add lightweight progress indicators and reminders so learners know when to complete follow-up checks.
    - Resolve outstanding Swift concurrency warnings tied to shared formatters introduced by the new lesson components.
31. **Phase 31 – Attachment Experience Enhancements**
    - Extend attachment presentation with inline previews/captions and map `file_search` IDs to human-readable filenames and titles.
    - Harden upload/preview flows for large artifacts with resumable transfers and checksum validation.
    - Document attachment lifecycle policies ahead of persistence migration completion.
32. **Phase 32 – Citation UX & Linking**
    - Refresh the agent + client rendering pipeline so Markdown citations consistently show richer metadata across chat, lessons, and dashboard views.
    - Surface backend citation metadata in UI chip components with quick-open/download affordances.
    - Add regression coverage ensuring citation targets remain accessible after persistence migration.
33. **Phase 33 – MCP Marketplace Discoverability**
    - Build an MCP marketplace surface in the macOS dashboard so learners can browse, search, and filter curated connectors (e.g., PubMed).
    - Provide detailed connector sheets that outline capabilities, permissions, accessibility notes, and expected usage costs before enabling.
    - Gate marketplace access behind onboarding state and capture discovery telemetry to inform future curation and prioritisation.
34. **Phase 34 – MCP Tool Governance & Runtime Integration**
    - Persist per-learner marketplace selections, enforce permission prompts, and expose backend configuration APIs that hydrate only approved MCP endpoints.
    - Update the agent/tooling layer to bootstrap conversations with learner-selected MCPs while enforcing quotas, safety policies, and graceful fallback behaviour.
    - Document contributor and operations checklists for introducing new connectors, including review cadence, rollback procedure, and telemetry expectations.
35. **Phase 35 – Code Editor Foundations**
    - Ship syntax highlighting, inline formatting, and editor shortcuts inside assessment and lesson surfaces ahead of richer quiz flows.
    - Respect accessibility preferences (font sizing, colour themes, reduced motion) across every code-entry context.
    - Add UI tests that lock in the new editor behaviours and keyboard interactions.
36. **Phase 36 – Interactive Quiz Runner**
    - Build an in-app quiz runner with interactive question types, attempt tracking, and immediate feedback loops.
    - Integrate the new code editor components and ensure quizzes capture attempt metadata for follow-up analysis.
    - Ensure accessibility and offline considerations are met for the upgraded quiz surfaces.
37. **Phase 37 – Assessment Review Surfaces**

    - Surface recent grading highlights directly in the dashboard and chat detail panels with accessible navigation.
    - Add UI regression coverage for the review flows, including verification that unseen-result badges clear as expected.
38. **Phase 38 – Adaptive Feedback Routing**
    - Pipe quiz and assessment outcomes into ELO updates with clearer explanations of rating deltas, confidence bands, and next-step recommendations.
    - Sync key feedback summaries back into the agent context so coaching conversations reference the latest review data.
    - Ensure grading prompts and storage schemas support richer rationale snippets per category/outcome.
39. **Phase 39 – Learner Insight Nudges**
    - Capture telemetry on assessment retries, snoozes, and follow-up completions to power personalised nudges.
    - Trigger in-app reminders and chat suggestions that align with pending schedule items or weak categories.
    - Expose opt-in controls and audit logging so learners can tune reminder frequency.
40. **Phase 40 – Reassessment & Refresh Cadence**
    - Schedule periodic reassessments and surface their status alongside historical submissions.
    - Adapt refresher frequency based on recent grading outcomes and learner momentum.
    - Define thresholds for triggering reassessment vs. lightweight check-ins.
41. **Phase 41 – Developer Sandbox & Execution Toggles**
    - Evaluate optional lint/run hooks for in-app prompts and surface clear affordances when sandbox execution is available.
    - Provide developer-oriented toggles for sandboxed execution, logging verbosity, and failure triage.
    - Document the security and resource guardrails required before enabling execution in production.
42. **Phase 42 – API Reliability & Test Coverage**
    - Expand automated tests for profile, assessment, and submission endpoints (happy path, retries, and grading fallbacks).
    - Add contract tests for assessment history payloads, including legacy compatibility verification.
    - Integrate the new telemetry signals into CI to guard against tool invocation regressions and attachment ingestion failures.
43. **Phase 43 – Evaluation & Benchmarking Framework**
    - Validate GPT-graded outcomes against representative human reviews and build a replayable evaluation harness.
    - Curate ground-truth datasets across lesson types and surface scorecards to the team.
    - Track model drift and regression deltas, feeding results into adaptive curriculum decisions.
44. **Phase 44 – Adaptive Safety & Prompt Hardening**
    - Tune grading and response prompts (language, scoring thresholds, guardrails) using insights from the evaluation framework.
    - Revisit default model/web-search settings, codify safety policies, and document escalation paths for risky content.
    - Align tooling with OpenAI policy updates and ensure guardrail prompts are centrally versioned.
45. **Phase 45 – Agent Observability Dashboards**
    - Build dashboards tracking agent tool usage, grading latency, unseen-result telemetry, token consumption, and database health (`db_pool_status`).
    - Connect the dashboards to alerting thresholds so on-call responders receive actionable signals.
    - Feed dashboard metrics back into release readiness reviews and on-call runbooks.
46. **Phase 46 – QA & Release Readiness**
    - Run full-stack QA passes covering onboarding, curriculum sequencing, reassessments, and chat flows.
    - Implement a preflight checklist for the Render deploy (env vars, secrets, migrations, observability hooks).

47. **Phase 47 – Agent Configuration & Runbooks**
    - Harden configuration syncing across dev/staging/prod and document operational runbooks.
    - Expand alert routing (web search success, migration duration, telemetry failures) and codify the escalation matrix.
    - Finalise playbooks for release, rollback, and incident response.
## Known Corrections & References

### Schedule slice reapplication after launches (added October 15, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** Launching or completing a scheduled item replaced the learner’s sliced view with the full horizon because the client overwrote the cached slice with the backend’s whole schedule payload.
- **Correct approach:** Preserve the previously requested slice window, merge incoming schedule updates, and reapply the slice so the UI stays on the learner’s current context while still caching the full schedule.
- **Action for future work:** Add automated coverage that exercises launch/complete flows from sliced schedules and alert if future changes regress slice preservation (tracked under Phase 26 follow-ups).

### SwiftUI overlay sizing and scroll behaviour (added October 12, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** The onboarding assessment overlay enforced a tall fixed frame, so on shorter displays the system clipped content instead of allowing the inner `ScrollView` to scroll. Progress also counted untouched starter code as valid responses.
- **Correct approach:** Compute modal width/height from the available viewport (via `GeometryReader`) and cap the scrollable region rather than forcing a minimum larger than the window. For code prompts, compare the learner’s response against the starter snippet and only mark the task answered after additional edits.
- **Action for future work:** When introducing new overlays or starter snippets, ensure sizing logic bounds the content to the viewport and treat template text as unanswered until modified.

### Agents function_tool strict schema (added October 12, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** We assumed that returning Pydantic models with `ConfigDict(extra="forbid")` would satisfy the OpenAI Agents `function_tool` strict JSON-schema requirements. Render deploys failed because the generated schema still contained `additionalProperties`, triggering `agents.exceptions.UserError`.
- **Correct approach:** When defining new agent tools with complex parameter schemas, explicitly set `@function_tool(strict_mode=False)` or design parameter models that yield compliant schemas. Review the Structured Outputs/Agents documentation before introducing or modifying tools that return complex payloads: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs.
- **Action for future work:** Before starting any phase or task that adds/modifies agent tools, read the linked docs and ensure strict-mode compatibility or intentionally disable strict mode with an accompanying justification.

### GPT-5 Codex tool support (added October 13, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** We treated `gpt-5-codex` as a limited-offline model that could not perform web search and rejected all attachments, leading to unnecessary 400 errors and weak answers.
- **Correct approach:** Codex supports web search but only accepts image uploads; other GPT-5 variants support the full attachment set. Pass the correct capability flags from the client and ensure prompts steer the agent to call `file_search` when files are available.
- **Action for future work:** Whenever we onboard a new model, verify its supported tools in OpenAI’s release notes before hard-coding capability constraints.

### MCP route registration & tool invocation (added October 12, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** We defined the `/mcp` OPTIONS/HEAD routes outside `create_proxy_app`, so FastAPI never registered them. OpenAI’s agent bootstrap saw 405/307 responses and the backend bubbled 424 errors. We also briefly used the non-existent JSON-RPC method `call_tool`.
- **Correct approach:** Register all MCP proxy routes inside `create_proxy_app`, ensure the proxy rewrites the path to `mcp.settings.streamable_http_path` (with trailing slash), and invoke tools with `tools/call` plus `params={"name": ..., "arguments": {...}}`.
- **Action for future work:** When adding proxy routes or middleware, confirm they’re attached during app construction and validate with `curl` (`initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`) before relying on the OpenAI-side integration.

### ReasoningEffort enum usage (added October 12, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** We attempted to instantiate `ReasoningEffort(...)`, which fails because the OpenAI SDK exposes it as a typing `Union`/`Literal`. This caused grading runs to drop into the fallback branch.
- **Correct approach:** Pass the string literal directly (or cast) instead of calling the class constructor, e.g. `cast(ReasoningEffort, effort)`.
- **Action for future work:** Update any new agent tool wiring to pass raw string literals for reasoning effort tiers and add regression tests for the grading pipeline.

### Curriculum session sizing (added October 15, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** Sequencer heuristics produced single sessions exceeding 9 hours because reinforcement and deep-dive modules inherited long estimated durations.
- **Correct approach:** The sequencer now splits every oversized lesson/quiz/milestone into ≤120-minute parts, chaining prerequisites across parts so the learner receives the full content across multiple sessions.
- **Action for future work:** When authoring new curriculum modules, include realistic `estimated_minutes` values and ensure future phases (e.g., milestone guidance) respect the session-splitting helper rather than bypassing it.
- **Action for future work:** Whenever we upgrade the OpenAI SDK, confirm enum-like types remain string literals and avoid invoking them like classes. Review the type hints before wiring new agents.

### Web search enforcement & Markdown citations (added October 13, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** With web search toggled on, the agent still skipped `web_search` and returned plain-text source mentions, leaving learners without fresh context or clickable references.
- **Correct approach:** The prompt overlay must require `web_search` whenever the feature is enabled and instruct the model to format citations as Markdown hyperlinks; the client must render Markdown so links are clickable.
- **Action for future work:** When modifying prompts or chat presentation, confirm both tool invocation requirements and Markdown rendering remain intact, and add telemetry to detect regressions.

### Legacy profile payload compatibility (added October 13, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** Adding `assessment_submissions` to the learner profile payload caused older cached responses to fail decoding on macOS, blocking onboarding.
- **Correct approach:** Provide backward-compatible decoders (Swift + backend shim) that treat the new field as optional until persistence migration guarantees the updated schema everywhere.
- **Action for future work:** Remove the compatibility shim only after the persistence migration phases land and add contract tests (Phases 25–26) to guard against similar regressions.

### SwiftPM deployment targets & Swift 6 concurrency diagnostics (added October 13, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** Raising the deployment target to macOS 15 without updating the SwiftPM tools version triggered manifest failures, and Swift 6 surfaced concurrency warnings for shared `ISO8601DateFormatter` instances and other singletons.
- **Correct approach:** Bump `swift-tools-version` to 6.0 when targeting macOS 15+, and isolate shared Foundation formatters/registries behind `@MainActor` or Sendable-safe wrappers to satisfy Swift 6 diagnostics.
- **Action for future work:** Complete the formatter refactor during Phase 29’s reliability work so no `@MainActor` globals leak into Sendable contexts.

### Schedule refresh query encoding (added October 13, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** The macOS dashboard refresh button percent-encoded the entire `schedule?refresh=true` path segment, so the backend received `/schedule%3Frefresh%3Dtrue` and returned 404s instead of regenerating schedules.
- **Correct approach:** Build schedule URLs with `URLComponents`, keeping the path untouched and adding `refresh=true` as a proper query item.
- **Action for future work:** Whenever new API calls are added to the client, prefer `URLComponents` for path/query composition and cover them with integration tests so encoded routes are caught before release.

### Agent schedule prompt alignment (added October 14, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** Even after generating schedules, Arcadia Coach kept asking learners for calendar exports because the system prompt never told it to read `curriculum_schedule`.
- **Correct approach:** Update the prompt to instruct the agent to consume `curriculum_schedule`, sort items by `recommended_day_offset`, and translate offsets into dated summaries when answering scheduling questions.
- **Action for future work:** Whenever we adjust profile payloads or scheduling data, double-check the prompt overlay so the agent explicitly references the new fields and time semantics.

### Schedule regeneration short-circuit (added October 14, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** Refreshing a schedule immediately after deferring an item rewrote the unchanged profile JSON, so the request stalled behind a multi-minute disk write on Render.
- **Correct approach:** Detect unchanged sequencer output, skip persistence when no fields differ, and emit telemetry with `status="unchanged"` so we can monitor redundant refreshes.
- **Action for future work:** Extend the short-circuit to future persistence migrations and alert if `schedule_generation` repeatedly reports large `duration_ms` despite unchanged payloads.

### Alembic config interpolation placeholders (added October 15, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** Running `python -m scripts.run_migrations` on Render raised `InterpolationMissingOptionError` because `alembic.ini` still contained the placeholder `%(ARCADIA_DATABASE_URL)s`, which ConfigParser treats as an unresolved variable.
- **Correct approach:** Detect missing interpolation in the migration wrapper, fall back to the `ARCADIA_DATABASE_URL` environment variable, and keep `alembic.ini` generic for local development.
- **Action for future work:** When introducing new deployment scripts, exercise them against containerised environments that mimic Render’s ConfigParser behaviour and add companion tests that simulate missing interpolation.

### Foundation coverage gaps in curriculum (added October 14, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** The adaptive curriculum assumed learners already had broad Python/data foundations, so onboarding plans after low assessment scores still generated only ~13 items without introducing prerequisite languages, libraries, or extended assessment coverage.
- **Correct approach:** Expand the foundation module library, allow dynamic ELO categories, and regenerate schedules with multi-month scaffolding whenever the learner’s goals or assessment results indicate missing fundamentals.
- **Action for future work:** As part of Phase 16, ship telemetry that tracks which foundation tracks are activated per learner and add authoring tools so we can continue extending the module catalog without code changes.

### Current time tool & timezone propagation (added October 14, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** The agent defaulted to UTC when reporting timestamps, even after we localised schedules, because it lacked a clock tool and the backend wasn’t forwarding learner timezone metadata.
- **Correct approach:** Introduce a `current_time` function tool, update prompts to call it, and ensure the macOS client/backend pass the learner’s timezone with every chat turn.
- **Action for future work:** Monitor tool usage, surface telemetry for localisation mismatches, and add a client-facing timezone override control.

### Sequencer long-range refresh imbalance (added October 14, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** `_inject_long_range_refreshers` let the highest-priority category monopolise long-range lessons/quizzes, leaving peers like Systems & Architecture without reinforcement for months.
- **Correct approach:** Distribute refreshers across all high-priority categories with per-category completion checks and pacing guardrails, then verify balance through new regression tests and telemetry.
- **Action for future work:** Addressed in Phase 18 – Sequencer Long-Range Balancing; monitor the new `long_range_distribution` telemetry and expand smoothing heuristics if imbalance reappears.

### Alembic migrations require `psycopg` driver hint (added October 15, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** Render pre-deploys failed (`ModuleNotFoundError: psycopg2`) because SQLAlchemy defaulted to the legacy `psycopg2` driver while the project depends on `psycopg[binary]`.
- **Correct approach:** Use a connection URL prefixed with `postgresql+psycopg://` (and keep the dependency pinned) so Alembic loads the correct driver during migrations.
- **Action for future work:** When provisioning new environments or rotating secrets, double-check the driver prefix in `ARCADIA_DATABASE_URL`, and document migration CLI usage (`uv run --active alembic …`) to avoid environment mismatches.

### Dashboard duplication & schedule slicing (added October 15, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** Legacy profiles with inconsistent category keys surfaced duplicate tiles, and the macOS dashboard only requested schedule slices after a manual refresh.
- **Correct approach:** Canonicalise ELO category keys from labels, dedupe foundation tracks on read, and trigger the first sliced refresh automatically so the UI shows a single tile per category with an immediate "Load more" control.
- **Action for future work:** Expand dedupe heuristics to catch punctuation-only differences and add UI regression tests that enforce one tile per category/track.

### SwiftUI `textSelection` AttributeGraph cycle (added October 15, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** Applying `.textSelection(.enabled)` to high-level dashboard containers caused AttributeGraph to recurse through dependent layout attributes, printing `=== AttributeGraph: cycle detected` and freezing the UI.
- **Correct approach:** Limit selection modifiers to leaf content, share clipboard logic via `AppClipboardManager`, and provide context-menu copy affordances without wrapping entire `VStack` hierarchies.
- **Action for future work:** When enabling new accessibility or selection affordances, exercise affected views under Instruments, add telemetry for layout-cycle warnings, and gate modifiers behind focused unit/UI coverage.

### Xcode target source registration (added October 15, 2025)
- **What went wrong:** Adding `AssessmentResultTracker.swift` only to SwiftPM left the Xcode project unaware of the file, and the project briefly treated the `Views/Dashboard` folder as a source file, causing `Cannot find 'AssessmentResultTracker' in scope` and “no rule to process file” build failures.
- **Correct approach:** Whenever we introduce new Swift sources or tests, add them to both SwiftPM and the Xcode target, and ensure groups remain directories rather than file references during project edits.
- **Action for future work:** After creating new files, run `xcodebuild -scheme ArcadiaCoach build` (or open Xcode) to confirm the target compiles, and document any manual project edits in the phase notes so others can replicate them.
