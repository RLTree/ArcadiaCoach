# Arcadia Coach ‚Äì Render Deployment Quickstart

This guide shows how to deploy the Path‚ÄØ2 stack‚ÄîFastAPI ChatKit backend plus MCP widget server‚Äîon https://arcadiacoach.com using Render Web Services. The macOS client continues to talk only to your custom backend; OpenAI‚Äôs Agent Builder is not required.

---

## 1. Prepare Credentials

Collect these secrets before provisioning services:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` ‚Äì project/org key with Agents + Responses access
- Optional overrides:
  - `ARCADIA_AGENT_MODEL` (default `gpt-5`)
  - `ARCADIA_AGENT_REASONING` (`minimal|low|medium|high`, default `medium`)
  - `ARCADIA_AGENT_ENABLE_WEB` (`true`/`false`)
- MCP settings:
  - `ARCADIA_MCP_URL` (to be populated after MCP deploy)
  - `ARCADIA_MCP_LABEL` (default `Arcadia_Coach_Widgets`)
  - `ARCADIA_MCP_REQUIRE_APPROVAL` (default `never`)

---

## 2. Deploy the MCP Widget Server (Render Web Service)

1. Push the repo (or a fork) to GitHub so Render can pull it.
2. In Render, create a **Web Service**:
   - Repository: `ArcadiaCoach`
   - Root Directory: `mcp_server`
   - Runtime: Python 3.12
   - Build Command: `uv sync`
   - Start Command: `uv run python server.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
3. Environment variables:
   - `ENVIRONMENT=production` (optional)
4. Deploy and note the public URL, e.g. `https://arcadia-mcp.onrender.com`.
5. Update your secrets with:

   ```
   ARCADIA_MCP_URL=https://arcadia-mcp.onrender.com/mcp
   ```

6. Validate the deployment:

   ```bash
   curl https://arcadia-mcp.onrender.com/health
   ```

   You should see `{"status":"ok","server":"arcadia-mcp"}`.

## 3. Deploy the FastAPI Backend (Render Web Service)

1. Create another **Web Service** in Render:
   - Repository: `ArcadiaCoach`
   - Root Directory: `backend`
   - Runtime: Python 3.12
   - Build Command: `uv sync`
   - Start Command: `uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
2. Add environment variables:

   | Key | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `<your OpenAI key>` |
   | `ARCADIA_AGENT_MODEL` | `gpt-5` (or preferred model) |
   | `ARCADIA_AGENT_REASONING` | `medium` |
   | `ARCADIA_AGENT_ENABLE_WEB` | `false` |
   | `ARCADIA_MCP_URL` | `https://arcadia-mcp.onrender.com/mcp` |
   | `ARCADIA_MCP_LABEL` | `Arcadia_Coach_Widgets` |
   | `ARCADIA_MCP_REQUIRE_APPROVAL` | `never` |

3. Deploy the service. After the health check passes, visit:

   ```
   https://arcadiacoach.onrender.com/healthz
   ```

   Expected output: `{"status":"ok","mode":"custom-chatkit"}`.

4. Smoke-test the lesson route:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://arcadiacoach.onrender.com/api/session/lesson \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"topic":"transformers","session_id":"render-test"}'
   ```

   You should receive a JSON payload shaped like `EndLearn`.

## 4. Wire Up `arcadiacoach.com`

1. In Render, open the backend service ‚Üí **Settings ‚Üí Custom Domains**.
2. Add `arcadiacoach.com` (and `www.arcadiacoach.com` if desired).
3. Render provides A/ALIAS records. In your DNS provider, point the domain to Render‚Äôs IPs.
4. After SSL is provisioned, confirm:

   ```
   https://arcadiacoach.com/healthz
   ```

5. If you require a domain key (OpenAI allow-list), generate it in the OpenAI dashboard and store it as `ARCADIA_DOMAIN_KEY`. The macOS app will read it from Settings ‚Üí ChatKit Backend.

---

## 5. Configure the macOS Client

1. Build and run the app from Xcode.
2. In **Settings ‚Üí ChatKit Backend**:
   - Backend base URL: `https://arcadiacoach.com/`
   - Domain key: paste your OpenAI domain key if the backend enforces it.
3. Return to **Home** and trigger lesson/quiz/milestone. The app now calls Render-hosted endpoints:
   - `POST https://arcadiacoach.com/api/session/lesson`
   - `POST https://arcadiacoach.com/api/session/quiz`
   - `POST https://arcadiacoach.com/api/session/milestone`
   - `POST https://arcadiacoach.com/api/session/chat`

> For the ChatKit widget embedded in the ‚ÄúAgent Chat‚Äù tab, ensure the Render domain is allow-listed in OpenAI so static assets and SSE streams aren‚Äôt blocked.

---

## 6. Maintenance Tips

- Backend logs in Render show detailed errors from the `/api/session/*` routes; 502 responses typically indicate an upstream OpenAI failure or misconfigured env var.
- To rotate secrets, update the Render environment variables and redeploy.
- Keep `uv.lock` under source control so Render uses consistent dependencies.
- If you change the MCP server URL, remember to update `ARCADIA_MCP_URL` on the backend service.

With these two Render services live, the macOS client stays in sync with the Path‚ÄØ2 architecture‚Äîno direct calls to api.openai.com from the app, and all agent orchestration happens inside your controlled backend. üöÄ
