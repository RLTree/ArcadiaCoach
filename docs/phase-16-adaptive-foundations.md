# Phase 16 – Adaptive Foundations & Assessment Overhaul

**Completion date:** October 14, 2025  
**Owner:** Backend & macOS cross-functional swarm

## Goals
- Introduce a dedicated Goal Parser agent that infers the learner’s prerequisite technology stack and prioritised foundation tracks.
- Expand curriculum augmentation to draw from a living module library, respecting track weights and assessment gaps.
- Redesign onboarding assessments into multi-section diagnostics that baseline conceptual, coding, data, architecture, and tooling skills.
- Update the sequencer to emit multi-month roadmaps with additional deep-dive reinforcements for high-priority tracks.

## Delivered
- Implemented `goal_parser.ensure_goal_inference`, persisting track-weighted `GoalParserInference` snapshots on learner profiles and exposing them via REST/agent payloads.
- Reworked foundation augmentation to ingest goal parser tracks, synthesise missing categories/modules, and merge track notes + target outcomes into curriculum success criteria.
- Overhauled onboarding assessment generation with section-aware tasks (Concept, Coding, Data, Architecture, Tooling) and surfaced the structure through API + Swift models.
- Extended the curriculum sequencer with track-weight boosts, longer 12-week horizons, and automated “Deep Dive” reinforcement lessons when foundation tracks demand additional spaced practice.
- Refreshed the macOS client: decoding goal inference data, rendering a Foundation Tracks dashboard card, and updating the assessment flow to browse sectioned tasks with richer context.

## Validation & Testing
- `uv run pytest` inside `backend/`
- `swift test`
- Manual sanity checks:
  - Triggered onboarding plan to inspect persisted `goal_inference` + `foundation_tracks`.
  - Exercised Onboarding Assessment flow to validate section navigation and task metadata.
  - Loaded dashboard to confirm Foundation Tracks card and deep-dive schedule items render.

## Follow-ups
- Stream goal parser + deep-dive telemetry into observability dashboards and monitor latent durations.
- Expand module library authoring tools and documentation so track coverage can be extended without code changes.
- Add UI coverage for sectioned assessments (snapshot tests) and enrich the Foundation Tracks card with progress indicators once ELO deltas land.
