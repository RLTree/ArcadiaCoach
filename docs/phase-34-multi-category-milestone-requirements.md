# Phase 34 â€“ Multi-Category Milestone Requirements

**Completed:** October 17, 2025  
**Owners:** Backend + macOS Client

## Summary
- Generated deterministic milestone requirement sets that blend the active milestone category with prerequisite modules and agent-authored project tags, using canonicalised category keys and telemetry for advisor fallbacks.
- Packaged requirement aggregates (met count, average progress, blocking categories) into API payloads so schedule cards, milestone queues, and MCP widgets surface unified progress states.
- Added learner-facing UI enhancements: milestone cards now show composite progress bars, focus chips, and clearer locking guidance aligned across dashboard and schedule views.
- Persisted requirement summaries and project `related_categories` through PostgreSQL migrations, SDK payloads, and Swift models to keep existing data backward-compatible.

## Testing
- `uv run ruff check`
- `uv run pytest backend`
- `swift test`
- `xcodebuild -project ArcadiaCoach.xcodeproj -scheme ArcadiaCoach -configuration Debug build`

## Follow-ups
- Extend telemetry dashboards to chart multi-category unlock rates and advisor fallback frequency.
- Update MCP widget payloads that render milestone summaries to include the new aggregated requirement data.
- Review BackendService date formatting warnings (`iso8601*` formatters) for actor isolation and convert to Sendable-safe accessors.
- Add regression coverage to ensure sliced schedules continue to include active milestone items so launch controls remain available after refreshes.
